# rk.tidyr
This package provides a suite of RKWard plugins that create a graphical user interface for data manipulation using the powerful `tidyr`, `dplyr`, and `tibble` libraries. It is designed to help users reshape data, handle missing values, and manage nested data structures—core tasks for achieving "Tidy Data"—without writing complex code manually.
